Bioinformatics Algorithms
==============

Here I will store the scripts I used to solve the bioinformatics algorithms problems in the "Algorithmic Heights" problem set on rosalind.com: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=algorithmic-heights. I will create another repository which I will use to store the scripts I use to solve the challenges in the Textbook Track on rosalind.
